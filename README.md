# dotfiles
Here are my personal dotfiles. The excellent [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is used to get them installed quickly on a new system.

In this repository I've included configuration files for the following software:

* Git
* ZSH
  * Oh My Zsh
* Vim
  * Vundle (and an assortment of plugins)
* Emacs
